	The version of python that I used for this project is version 3.7.0
	
	the solution to the problem is done in two python files.  

In the first python file, JsonConverter.py, the file takes a data.json file and converts it to the new style of json according to the spec.  This output file is called results.json.  

To run this file just run "python JsonConverter.py" in a directory that contains data.json

The second part of this problem is done in the solutions.py file.  this file takes a json file called data-transformed.json and outputs the resulting calculations to output.txt.  
	
to run this file just run "python solutions.py" in a directory that contains the data-transformed.json

For your convienience I have attached the sample files and my solutions to the problems in this file.
